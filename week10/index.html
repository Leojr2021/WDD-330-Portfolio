      <h2>Fetch</h2>
      <p>
        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and
        manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
        It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical
        way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

      <p>
        Here we are fetching a JSON file across the network and printing it to
        the console. The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path
        to the resource you want to fetch — and does not directly return the
        JSON response body but instead returns a promise that resolves with a
        Response object. The Response object, in turn, does not directly contain
        the actual JSON response body but is instead a representation of the
        entire HTTP response. So, to extract the JSON body content from the
        Response object, we use the json() method, which returns a second
        promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text
        as JSON.
