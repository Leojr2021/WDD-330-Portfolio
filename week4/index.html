      <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection
        of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the
        system. Objects contain both functions (or methods) and data. An object
        provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it but
        maintains its own private, internal state; other parts of the system
        don't have to care about what is going on inside the object.
      </p>

        properties:

      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <p>
        Objects provide an interface to other code that wants to use them but
        maintain their own internal state. The object's internal state is kept
        private, meaning that it can only be accessed by the object's own
        methods, not from other objects. Keeping an object's internal state
        private, and generally making a clear division between its public
        interface and its private internal state, is called encapsulation.
