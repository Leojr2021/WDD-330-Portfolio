      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>
        Searching for an error while we are programing it's very common.
        Sometimes there are logical or syntax errors that throw warning. The
        worst scenario is when the app break without any warning or error
        message. However, modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger
        that helps us to find and fix the bug or error. "console.log" it's the
        most used command.
      </p>
      <h2>Testing</h2>

      There are some reason to test our code. First, guarantee that our code
      works. Second, it's maintainable and understandable to your co-workers.
      Finally, it's more easy to find and fix a bug.
      <br />
      There are some framework that help with this task. For example Mocha which
      runs on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple
      and fun.
