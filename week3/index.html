      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p>
        HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript<br>
        is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events
      </p>

      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and<br>
        type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with<br>
        properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made<br>
        of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which<br>
        define their characteristics.<br>
      </p>

      <h2>DOM</h2>
      <p>The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:<br>
        <br>
        The HTML elements as objects<br>
        The properties of all HTML elements<br>
        The methods to access all HTML elements<br>
        The events for all HTML elements<br>
        In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.</p>
